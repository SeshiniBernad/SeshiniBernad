I am a Bachelor of Cyber Security student at Deakin University, graduating in June 2026. My studies, the Google Cybersecurity Professional Certificate, and Forage simulations with Telstra AU and Commonwealth Bank have built both technical and analytical confidence in security operations and governance. I approach cybersecurity with analytical thinking and emotional intelligence, ensuring that my decisions consider technical accuracy as well as collaboration and clear communication across teams. I view cybersecurity as a way to protect trust, people, and digital integrity through a balance of technology and responsible governance.

## üéØ Objective
My interest in cybersecurity began with a curiosity about how digital systems earn trust and how that trust can fail. Over time, that curiosity grew into a passion for understanding security from both a technical and policy-driven perspective. I focus on analysing risk, interpreting data, and strengthening organizational controls through governance and compliance frameworks such as ISO 27001 and NIST. My hands-on experience includes Linux, Python, Wireshark, Nmap, Splunk, pfSense, and basic forensic investigation using Autopsy. In the long term, I aspire to specialise in Governance, Risk and Compliance while staying grounded in practical security operations and continuous learning.
